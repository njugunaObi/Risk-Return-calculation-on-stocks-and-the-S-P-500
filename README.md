# Risk-Return-calculation-on-stocks-and-the-S-P-500

This project deals with calculating the risk and return ratio of Amazon and Facebook stock in 2016 as compared to the S&P 500.

I used the Sharpe ratio to calculate the estimated risk and return ratio and plotted them to show which asset had the better investment potential.
